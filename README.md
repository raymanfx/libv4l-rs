This crate provides safe bindings to the Video for Linux (V4L) stack. Modern device drivers will usually implement the `v4l2` API while older ones may depend on the legacy `v4l` API. Such legacy devices may be used with this crate by choosing the `libv4l` feature for this crate.

## Goals

This crate shall provide the `v4l-sys` package to enable full (but unsafe) access to `libv4l\*`.
On top of that, there will be a high level, more idiomatic API to use video capture devices on Linux.

There will be simple utility applications to list devices and capture frames.
A minimalistic OpenGL/Vulkan viewer to display frames is planned for the future.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/raymanfx/libv4l-rs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Cargo Features

This crate has two primary features:

* `libv4l`: uses the `libv4l` wrapper libraries.
  * Links against the `libv4l*` stack, including `libv4l1`, `libv4l2`, and `libv4lconvert`.
  * Has the advantage of emulating common capture formats such as RGB3 in userspace through `libv4lconvert` and more.
  * However, some features, like `userptr` buffers, are not supported in `libv4l`.
* `v4l2` (DEFAULT): uses the kernel's Video4Linux 2 kernel header directly.
  * Only uses the Linux kernel provided v4l2 API provided by `videodev2.h`.
  * You get support for all v4l2 features such as `userptr` buffers, but may need to do format conversion yourself if you require certain constructs (e.g. RGB/BGR buffers), which may not be supported by commodity devices such as webcams.

You must select exactly one of these features. Note that the `v4l2` feature is on by default. To use `libv4l` instead, you'll need to also use the `default-features = false` dependency key.

## Usage

Below you can find a quick example usage of this crate. It introduces the basics necessary to do frame capturing from a streaming device (e.g. webcam).

```rust
use v4l::buffer::Type;
use v4l::io::mmap::Stream;
use v4l::io::traits::CaptureStream;
use v4l::video::Capture;
use v4l::Device;
use v4l::FourCC;

fn main() {
    // Create a new capture device with a few extra parameters
    let mut dev = Device::new(0).expect("Failed to open device");

    // Let's say we want to explicitly request another format
    let mut fmt = dev.format().expect("Failed to read format");
    fmt.width = 1280;
    fmt.height = 720;
    fmt.fourcc = FourCC::new(b"YUYV");
    let fmt = dev.set_format(&fmt).expect("Failed to write format");

    // The actual format chosen by the device driver may differ from what we
    // requested! Print it out to get an idea of what is actually used now.
    println!("Format in use:\n{}", fmt);

    // Now we'd like to capture some frames!
    // First, we need to create a stream to read buffers from. We choose a
    // mapped buffer stream, which uses mmap to directly access the device
    // frame buffer. No buffers are copied nor allocated, so this is actually
    // a zero-copy operation.

    // To achieve the best possible performance, you may want to use a
    // UserBufferStream instance, but this is not supported on all devices,
    // so we stick to the mapped case for this example.
    // Please refer to the rustdoc docs for a more detailed explanation about
    // buffer transfers.

    // Create the stream, which will internally 'allocate' (as in map) the
    // number of requested buffers for us.
    let mut stream = Stream::with_buffers(&mut dev, Type::VideoCapture, 4)
        .expect("Failed to create buffer stream");

    // At this point, the stream is ready and all buffers are setup.
    // We can now read frames (represented as buffers) by iterating through
    // the stream. Once an error condition occurs, the iterator will return
    // None.
    loop {
        let (buf, meta) = stream.next().unwrap();
        println!(
            "Buffer size: {}, seq: {}, timestamp: {}",
            buf.len(),
            meta.sequence,
            meta.timestamp
        );

        // To process the captured data, you can pass it somewhere else.
        // If you want to modify the data or extend its lifetime, you have to
        // copy it. This is a best-effort tradeoff solution that allows for
        // zero-copy readers while enforcing a full clone of the data for
        // writers.
    }
}
```
